# **Photo Gallery Website**
* *This is a basic Photo Gallery website, designed with a modern sidebar and semi-transparent glassmorphism style.*
*  *Currently, only the front page is implemented, and the functionality is created using pure HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).*
*  *The sliding effect for the sidebar is achieved using the checkbox functionality in HTML, and the styling of the checked state is done using CSS.*
